# Brussels-Bike-Station-Availability
## Summary
The objective of this project is to create an easy-to-use tool for visualising bike station availability in real time in Processing. The output application is an interactive map showing all the available bikes and stands in Brussels as well as other information of the station at a certain time. Users can zoom in and select a station to check the details.
## Software and folder contents
The project is based on Processing 2.2.1 version. The “BrusselsBikeStations” folder includes a processing sketch and standalone applications for different platforms (Windows and Mac).
## Data source
The data used in this project is a CSV file, which contains location of the “Villo!” bike stations in the Brussels Capital Region with indication of the availability (bikes, bike stands) in real time. The dataset is downloaded from Brussels open store website (http://opendatastore.brussels/).
